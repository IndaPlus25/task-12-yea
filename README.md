I decided to implement the Conway's game of life, with some small tweaks. The guide I used was inside the rustaceans repo, but oh my lord it was so outdated and deprecated it was insane. I spent hours trying to fix so many problems because I had to keep switching different versions of this and that and how to use stuff in other ways. Overall, not a great experience. I am familiar with rust, and familiar with javascript and such, but it was at least a little interesting seeing the two mix.

To run the program, go into simulator/www/ and type 'npm start'. In case that doesn't work, type 'wasm-pack build' and then try npm start again. If even that doesn't work, I have no clue, it should, lol.

After the program has started running, go to your browser of choice and type http://localhost:8080/ into your search bar and enter.
